== High Level Architecture

The focus of testing is to evaluate functionality of various APIs and encodings to assess and evaluate for future data exchange guidance and technical regulation.

Core threads of work include:

- discrete sampling of NWP data and observations
- AI-driven search
- visualization of weather/climate/water products
- exploitation of data via custom processing workflows
- encodings for big multimensional data
- interfaces and encodings for cloud optimized data discovery and access
