== High level architecture

The focus of testing is to evaluate functionality of various APIs and encodings to assess and evaluate for future data exchange guidance and technical regulation.

=== Core work threads

Core threads of work include:

==== Discrete sampling of NWP data and observations

TODO

==== Interfaces and encodings for cloud optimized data discovery and access

TODO

==== Encodings for big multidimensional data

TODO

==== Visualization of weather/climate/water products

TODO

==== AI-driven search

TODO

==== Exploitation of data via custom processing workflows

TODO

==== Data usage insights, weblogs for Global Caches and Global Discovery Catalogues

TODO

=== Standards

The rest of this section describes the standards implemented during or in support of the interoperability experiment.
