[[testing]]
== High level architecture

The focus of testing is to evaluate functionality of various APIs and encodings to assess and evaluate for future data exchange guidance and technical regulation.

=== Core work threads

Core threads of work include:

==== Data access optimization for everyday users

This work thread will focus on data access patterns and encodings for meteorologists and Web developers
for discrete sampling of NWP data and observations.

==== Data access optimization for power users

This work thread will focus on data access patterns and encodings for researchers, data scientists and
other data experts working with a data integration viewpoint.

==== Toolkits for local NMHS operations

This work thread will focus on the development of a visualization toolbox for weather/climate/water
products in support of local NMHS operations.

==== Custom data processing

This work thread will focus on processing definitions for weather/climate/water related workflows, to facilitate
common tasks provided for WMO Members and data proximate computation.

==== AI-driven search

This work thread will focus on investigating value added capabilities on data and metadata made available by WIS2.

==== Data usage insights, weblogs for Global Caches and Global Discovery Catalogues

This work thread will focus on using metrics provided by WIS2 Global Cache and Global Discovery Catalogue services
to identify and analyze trends that can affect infrastructure planning and continuous improvement.

=== Standards

The rest of this section describes the standards implemented during or in support of the interoperability experiment.
