==== STAC encodings

The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) footnote:[https://stacspec.org] specification provides a common structure for describing and cataloging spatiotemporal assets.

A spatiotemporal asset is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

The STAC Specification consists of 4 semi-independent specifications. Each can be used alone, but they work best in concert with one another.

* STAC Item footnote:[https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md] is the core atomic unit, representing a single spatiotemporal asset as a GeoJSON feature plus datetime and links.
* STAC Catalog footnote:[https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/catalog-spec/catalog-spec.md] is a simple, flexible JSON file of links that provides a structure to organize and browse STAC Items. A series of best practices helps make recommendations for creating real world STAC Catalogs.
* STAC Collection footnote:[https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/collection-spec/collection-spec.md] is an extension of the STAC Catalog with additional information such as the extents, license, keywords, providers, etc that describe STAC Items that fall within the Collection.
