==== Zarr

Zarr footnote:[https://zarr.dev] is a community project to develop specifications and software for storage of large N-dimensional typed arrays, also commonly known as tensors. A particular focus of Zarr is to provide support for storage using distributed systems like cloud object stores, and to enable efficient I/O for parallel computing applications.

GeoZarr footnote:[https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec] to provide a geospatial extension to the Zarr specification. Zarr specifies a protocol and format used for storing Zarr arrays, while the present extension defines conventions and recommendations for storing multidimensional georeferenced grid of geospatial observations (including rasters).
