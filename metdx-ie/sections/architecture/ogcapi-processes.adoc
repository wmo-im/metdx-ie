==== OGC API - Processes

The OGC API - Processes footnote:[https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes] standard supports the wrapping of computational tasks into executable processes that can be offered by a server through a Web API and be invoked by a client application. The standard specifies a processing interface to communicate over a RESTful protocol using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encodings. Typically, these processes execute well-defined algorithms that ingest vector and/or coverage data to produce new datasets.
